# Worker Safety Detection using YOLOv5 ðŸ¦º

## ðŸ“Œ Overview
This project focuses on **worker safety** by detecting whether workers are wearing safety helmets.  
The model is based on **YOLOv5**, trained on a custom dataset of images labeled for helmets and workers.  
The aim is to help improve workplace safety by automatically detecting unsafe conditions in real time.  

---

## ðŸš€ Features
- Detects if workers are wearing **helmets** or not.  
- Real-time object detection using **YOLOv5**.  
- Can be applied to both **images** and **videos**.  
- Custom-trained model with dataset relevant to worker safety.
